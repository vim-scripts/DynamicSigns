This plugin enables you to use signs |sign-support| for different things. For
example you can use signs to display Indentation-Levels, display line
whitespace errors, display marks |mark-motion|, display the differences
between the current editing file and the file on disk or whenever an
expression evalutates true (similar to how fold-expressions work |fold-expr|)

All you need to do, is configure the plugin by setting some configuration
variables and run |:Signs|
